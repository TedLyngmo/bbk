To build a simple Unix TPTEST client, do:

1. Make a project directory.

2. Copy all the necessary files there. You'll need the engine files
   from the engine/ directory. They are tpengine.c, tpengine.h, tpcommon.c
   tpcommon.h, tpclient.c and tpclient.h. You'll also need the Unix I/O
   module, tpio_unix.c and tpio_unix.h, which are found in the os-dep/unix/
   directory. Finally you'll need all the files in this directory.

3. Edit the Makefile so that it suits you.

4. Build.
