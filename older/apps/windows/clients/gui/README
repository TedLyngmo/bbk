To build the GUI Win32 TPTEST client, do:

1. Make a project directory.

2. Copy all the necessary files there. You'll need the engine files
   (tpengine.c, tpengine.h, tpcommon.c, tpcommon.h, tpclient.c, tpclient.h),
   the files in this directory, and the files in the os-dep/win32 directory
   (tpio_win32.c, tpio_win32.h).

3. Create a project with all the files included.

4. Build.

   Libraries you'll need: ws2_32.lib libcmt.lib (or libcmtd for debug)
 
   In Visual C++ go to Project->Settings, select the C/C++ tab,
   Select "Code Generation" from the dropdown-menu, set the compiler
   to use the multithreaded or multithreaded debug runtime-library.

   To avoid a compiler warning you might want to exclude libc (which
   is replaced by libcmt). When compiling a debug version, exclude libcd,
   otherwise exclude libc.


Good luck!
