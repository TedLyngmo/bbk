TPTEST applications changelog
-----------------------------



TPTEST 3.15:


 - apps/unix/client

   Rewritten client app. It now does TPTEST 3 and TPTEST 4. Can be run in
   standalone, repeating mode (performing repeated tests) or via cron. It
   can log its output to stdout or syslog and has 3 different verbosity
   levels.

   Requires a TPTEST 3.15 or later engine version.




TPTEST 3.16:


 - apps/unix/client

   Added -S and -R options to enable the client to set socket send- and receive
   buffers to other values than the default for the OS used.

   Setting send- and receive buffers to a certain value on both client and
   server side will result in a corresponding TCP window size being negotiated
   between the machines when a test is run.




TPTEST 3.17:

 - apps/unix/client

   Fixed two bugs in client.c that caused TPTEST/Stat results to not be
   accepted by the TPTEST/Stat database. The first was engp->stats.email and 
   engp->stats.pwd not being initialized, causing the client to transmit
   result reports with those fields empty. The second bug was the client not
   initializing engp->stats.MajorVersion and engp->stats.MinorVersion,
   causing the client to report 0 (zero) for both those when sending stat
   reports to the server. The program (dbinsert) responsible for inserting
   test results into the database checks these version numbers and discards
   test results that come with version numbers below 3.0.
