For more detailed information on the TPTEST system, please read the file
tptest3.txt which should be located in the same directory as this file.

The TPTEST test engine consists of three files. tpengine.c is the main file,
containing most of the engine functionality. tpcommon.c contains some common
functions that aren't strictly related to the TPTEST engine but which the 
engine uses. tpclient.c contains support functions for client applications.

To build the engine files tpengine.o, tpcommon.o and tpclient.o you should
first scan tpengine.h and make sure nothing weird is #defined there, then
you need to make sure you have the right things defined for *your* OS. 

To compile under	Define
--------------------------------------------------
Windows			WIN32
MacOS			MACOS
OpenBSD			UNIX, OPENBSD
FreeBSD/NetBSD		UNIX, OPENBSD
Linux			UNIX, LINUX
Solaris			UNIX, SOLARIS

That is, either modify tpengine.h and add a couple #define lines at the
beginning or give your compiler "-DUNIX -DSOLARIS" arguments when compiling.

For other operating systems than the ones listed above, try something you
think gets close to what you have. SysV users can try the Solaris setup,
*BSD* users can try the OpenBSD one.

Good luck.
