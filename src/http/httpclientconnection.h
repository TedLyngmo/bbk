class HttpClientTask;

/// \brief
/// HTTP/1.1 client protocol.
///
/// This class implements a small subset of the HTTP/1.1 client protocol.
/// A connection will be made to the given hostname/port.
/// When the connection is ready for a new HTTP request, the owner
/// task's method newRequest(HttpClientConnection *conn) will be called.
/// To use this class, you must derive from HttpClientTask and implement the
/// newRequest method to perform HTTP requests over the HttpClientConnection.
///
/// A call to the owner task's headerComplete will be made when response
/// headers are read. If headerComplete returns false the connection
/// will be dropped.
///
/// Within headerComplete you may call conn->doStreamResponse()
/// if you want the respone to be "streamed" to you, i.e. to be notified
/// (by a call to the owner task's payload method) whenever a part of the
/// response arrives. The default is for this class to buffer the response
/// and only notify the ower task when the complete response has been received.
///
/// A call to the owner task's requestComplete will be made when the complete
/// response has been read. If requestComplete returns false the connection
/// will be dropped. Otherwise, the newRequest will be called again so that
/// a new HTTP request can be made.
/// Within requestComplete, you can call contents() to get the HTTP response
/// unless doStreamResponse() was called before.
