/// \brief
/// The purpose of a task is to manage socket connections, and/or to execute
/// timers.
///
/// This is essentially an abstract base class. You must create subclasses and
/// pass subclass objects to the EventLoop's addTask method.
///
/// Timers are very simple; the start method must return the number of seconds
/// until the timerEvent method should be called. The overridden timerEvent can
/// do whatever it needs and then return the number of seconds until it should
/// be called again. A value <= 0 means it will never be called again.
///
/// Note that the application will be single threaded. Thus, timers (and other
/// callbacks) must avoid blocking and generally try do be as quick as possible,
/// otherwise all subsequent timers will be delayed.
///
/// The Task may create SocketConnection objects and add them using the
/// addConnection method. It may also create ServerSocket objects and
/// add them with addServer; whenever a client connects to the server,
/// you will be notified through the newClient method.
