// A SocketConnection object represents a socket connection. Inherit from this
// class to implement a "protocol" for the connection, i.e. when/what to
// read/write through the connection.
//
// Each SocketConnection is owned by a Task object. SocketConnection objects
// will be added to the network Engine (a part of the EventLoop) through the
// task's addConnection method.
//
// The subclass will be notified through callback functions when
// anything happens on the socket, i.e. if the socket has been closed, if data
// has arrived, or if the socket is writable.
// You define the callback functions by overloading the below virtual functions.
// All operations will be performed asynchronously (non-blocking) except for
// dns lookups, which are performed synchronously (blocking).
//
// Note! You _must_ create the SocketConnection objects with new. The ownership
// will then be passed to the network engine.
// You are not allowed to delete a SocketConnection object.
// We will delete it when the connection has been closed, which will be
//
//  1) If you order us to close it by returning CLOSE, KEEPALIVE or KILL from
//     a callback, or
//
//  2) After the closedByPeer callback, if the connection has been
//     closed by peer.
//
//  3) After the connectionFailed callback, if the connection couldn't
//     be established in the first place.
//
// The owner task will be notified before the object is deleted.
