/// \brief
/// This class implements low-level socket connection operations.
/// Inherit from it to implement protocols like HTTP.
///
/// A SocketConnection object represents a socket connection. Inherit from this
/// class to implement a "protocol" for the connection, i.e. when/what to
/// read/write through the connection.
///
/// Each SocketConnection is owned by a Task object. SocketConnection objects
/// will be added to the network Engine (a part of the EventLoop) through the
/// task's addConnection method.
///
/// The subclass will be notified through callback functions when
/// anything happens on the socket, i.e. if the socket has been closed, if data
/// has arrived, or if the socket is writable.
/// You define the callback functions by overloading the below virtual functions.
/// All operations will be performed asynchronously (non-blocking) except for
/// dns lookups, which are performed synchronously (blocking).
///
/// Note! You _must_ create the SocketConnection objects with new. The ownership
/// will then be passed to the network engine.
/// You are not allowed to delete a SocketConnection object.
/// We will delete it when the connection has been closed, which will be
///
///  1) If you order us to close it by returning CLOSE, KEEPALIVE or KILL from
///     a callback, or
///
///  2) After the closedByPeer callback, if the connection has been
///     closed by peer.
///
///  3) After the connectionFailed callback, if the connection couldn't
///     be established in the first place.
///
/// The owner task will be notified before the object is deleted.
