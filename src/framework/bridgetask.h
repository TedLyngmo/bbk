/// \brief
/// Tasks may use a bridge to communicate with an application running
/// outside the event loop.
///
/// This class provides an abstract interface for a _bridge_ which facilitates
/// communication between a task and code running outside the event loop.
/// The code might run in another process or thread. The actual
/// means of communication might be sockets or pipes, or shared variables in
/// the case of threads, or something else entirely.
///
/// The task running in the event loop is called the _agent_, and the outside
/// aplication is called the _client_.
///
/// To use this class, you must
///    - derive from this class
///    - implement the sendMessageToClient method
///    - implement a way for the client to send messages back, and pass those
///      messages through the sendMsgToAgent method
///    - if you override the start() method, call BridgeTask::start() first
///    - create an agent object and a bridge object
///    - add the bridge object to the event loop
/// The agent task will be aborted when the bridge task is finished.
/// If you need timers (e.g. for polling), you must override the start() method
/// below and your start() method must call BridgeTask::start().
///
/// When there is a message from the client to the agent, the agent's
/// Task::handleExecution method will be called with two parameters:
/// the bridge object and a message.
///
/// Typically, the agent's Task::handleExecution method checks if the
/// first parameter can be cast to a BridgeTask pointer.
/// If so, the second parameter is a message from the client.
/// When the first message from the client arrives, the agent stores
/// the pointer to the bridge in case it needs to send messages back.
