/// \brief
/// Client communicating with an agent task using a UnixDomainBridge.
///
/// This class is meant to be used only _outside_ the event loop, i.e. from some
/// other thread or process. It is used together with a UnixDomainBridge, which
/// runs in the event loop. After creating the UnixDomainBridge object, call
/// getClientSocket() on it to get a file descriptor which should be used as
/// an argument to the constructor of this class. Then make sure the
/// UnixDomainBridge object runs in an event loop, but not in the same thread or
/// process as this class.

    /// Will return an empty string if no message is available.

    /// Poll regularly or monitor the socket descriptor.

    /// *Note:* If the message is large (perhaps >200KB),
    /// it's likely that the complete message can't be delivered to the agent
    /// immediately. In that case, it will be buffered and you may have to
    /// call pushToAgent (with new messages) or flushToAgent() repeatedly until
    /// the buffer is drained. (Of course, unless the agent actively reads the
    /// messages, the buffer can't be drained.)
