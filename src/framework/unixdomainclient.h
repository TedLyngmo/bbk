// This class is meant to be used only _outside_ the event loop, i.e. from some
// other thread or process. It is used together with a UnixDomainBridge, which
// runs in the event loop. After creating the UnixDomainBridge object, call
// getClientSocket() on it to get a file descriptor which should be used as
// an argument to the constructor of this class. Then make sure the
// UnixDomainBridge object runs in an event loop, but not in the same thread or
// process as this class.
